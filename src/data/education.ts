    Approach:
      "I focus on building applications that are not only functional but also reliable and maintainable. My development approach emphasizes clean architecture, efficient backend logic, and intuitive user experiences, ensuring systems remain scalable and easy to evolve over time.",
    Focus:
      "I primarily work on full-stack web applications, building complete systems from responsive frontends to secure backend services and databases. I enjoy solving practical problems through code and turning ideas into usable products.",
    Awareness:
      "Alongside web development, I explore cybersecurity and digital forensics, which naturally influences how I design applications — paying attention to data handling, monitoring, and system reliability. This perspective helps me approach development with a stronger awareness of security and system behavior.",

    Direction:
      "I’m currently focused on improving system design skills, backend architecture, and building production-ready applications while continuing to explore security-aware engineering practices.",
